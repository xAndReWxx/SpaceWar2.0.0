## 👨‍💻 OOP Concepts in Action

- **Encapsulation**: Game entities like `Player`, `Enemy`, and `Bullet` are wrapped in classes with private data and public methods.
- **Abstraction**: Objects hide complex internals, exposing simple interfaces (e.g., `Update()`, `Draw()`).
- **Inheritance**: Shared functionality is inherited from base classes like `Entity` or `GameObject`.
- **Polymorphism**: Base pointers or virtual functions enable flexible object handling.

---

## 🧠 Design Patterns Utilized

- **Singleton Pattern**: Manages global resources (e.g., audio or game state).
- **Factory Pattern**: Creates objects like enemies or bullets dynamically.
- **State Pattern**: Switches between game states (Menu, Playing, Paused, Game Over).
